📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn, retention health, and recurring revenue for a SaaS business using Power BI.
The dashboard is built for decision-makers, focusing on executive KPIs, churn drivers, and revenue stability—not just reporting numbers, but explaining why churn happens and where to act.

🎯 Business Objectives

Measure overall customer churn rate

Track Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Monitor customer satisfaction (CSAT)

Identify industries and reasons driving churn

Enable analysis by industry, plan tier, and time period

📈 Key KPIs

The dashboard surfaces four executive-level KPIs for instant clarity:

Total Active MRR – Recurring revenue from active customers

Churn Rate (%) – Customers lost during the selected period

Total Accounts – Active customer base size

Average CSAT Score – Overall customer satisfaction indicator

These KPIs quickly reflect financial health, retention risk, and customer experience.

📊 Dashboard Components
1️⃣ KPI Summary Section

High-visibility KPI cards

Executive-first layout

Consistent color and formatting for fast interpretation

2️⃣ Churn Rate by Industry

Bar chart showing churn distribution by industry

Highlights high-risk sectors

Supports targeted retention strategies

3️⃣ Total Active MRR Trend

Line/area chart tracking revenue over time

Identifies growth, stagnation, or decline

Connects revenue trends with churn behavior

4️⃣ Churn Reasons Analysis

Treemap of churned customers by reason

Key drivers include pricing, features, support, and competition

Helps prioritize product and service improvements

5️⃣ Account-Level Insights

Detailed table with:

Industry

Active MRR

Average CSAT score

Enables deeper operational and customer-level analysis

6️⃣ Interactive Filters

Industry

Plan Tier

Date Range

Allows users to dynamically explore patterns and trends

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

DAX for KPI calculations

Star schema data modeling (fact & dimension tables)

Custom visual formatting and layout design

🧠 Key Insights

Certain industries consistently show higher churn risk

Revenue growth does not always align with customer count, indicating revenue concentration

Pricing and feature gaps are major churn drivers

Lower CSAT scores strongly correlate with churn

🎨 Design Principles

Executive-focused KPI placement

Minimal clutter with consistent color theme

Clear visual hierarchy

Business-first storytelling over raw metrics

🚀 How to Use

Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop

Apply slicers for industry, plan tier, or date

Review KPIs for overall business health

Drill into churn drivers to support retention decisions

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to:
